          Twelve years ago, I was a wedding photographer who loved being
          creative but didnâ€™t feel totally at home in my work. It was only when
          I discovered Showit, the drag-and-drop website platform that I
          realized I enjoyed building my website more than I liked doing
          anything else.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[14px] mt-6">
          That was when I combined my knowledge of the wedding industry with my
          passion for design and founded The Buffalo Collective, lovingly named
          for my hometown of Buffalo, NY and the artist community I fell in love
          with.
